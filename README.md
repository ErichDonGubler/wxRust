# wxRust

This is an attempt creating wxWidgets binding for Rust programming language.

## how it'll work

I'll build up a thin Rust wrapper of the wxc C-wrapped binding maintained at wxHaskell's repository.

## license

I'm planning the wxWidgets License for this library.

## build

There's no buildable artifacts now.
